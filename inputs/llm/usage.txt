How might I craft a title for a report, which describes that racial disparity was found in the distribution of Toronto's parks and facilities projects, but no income disparity was found? I wish to make it brief and clear. 

ChatGPT
Title: "Unveiling Racial Disparities: A Comprehensive Analysis of Toronto's Parks and Facilities Projects with Insights on Income Equality"

User
This isn't clear enough. Can you try again?

ChatGPT
"Exploring Racial Disparities in Toronto's Parks Projects: An Analysis of Equity in Facilities Distribution"

User
What about something like "Toronto's Parks and Recreation Facilities Projects Underrepresented in High-Minority Wards, but Fairly Represented in Low-Income Wards"?

ChatGPT 
Your proposed title effectively conveys the main findings of your report. However, if you're looking to make it more concise while maintaining clarity, you might consider:

"Parks Project Disparities: A Tale of Toronto's Wards"

User
That captures no relevant information for a scientific report.

ChatGPT 
I appreciate the clarification. How about this revised title:

"Racial Disparities in Toronto's Parks and Facilities Projects: A Ward-Based Analysis"

User
How to make this title of the subsection of my report clearer and briefer: "Relationship between the Number of Projects and the Visible Minority Population Percentage per Ward"?

ChatGPT 
"Project Count vs. Minority Population Percentage by Ward"
